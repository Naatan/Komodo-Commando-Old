Quite simply this adds a dialog in the same style of "Fast Open" that allows you to invoke commands, macro's and snippets.

It's basically the Invoke Tool with the look of "Fast Open" and the added functionality that you can use it to invoke any of the 450+ commands included with Komodo without having to use your mouse or needing to set a shortcut for them.
